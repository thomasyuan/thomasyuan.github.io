awk is a tool to process text, line by line.


## Variable
`$0` means whole line, `$1` means the first column, `NF` means the last column, 'NR' means nubmer of row. etc.
* List process name
```
ps | awk '{print $1}' 
```

## Seperator 
use `:` as seperator (default is space), print out the first, 6th and 7th column. use `Tab` between them.
```
awk -F ":" '{print $1"\t"$6"\t"$7}' /etc/passwd
```

## Change Seperator as output
use `:` as seperator, output use `Tab` as seperator, print out the first, 6th and 7th column. (Use comma in between, so they are columns, and awk can insert `Tab` in between.
```
awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"; OFS="\t"} {print $1, $6, $7}' /etc/passwd
```

## Print last column
search the line start with '/', use '/' as seperator, print out the last column.
```
awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells
```

## function
* print lines which is longer than 7
```
awk 'length($0) > 7' /etc/shells
```

* print all bash process
```
awk 'length($0) > 7' /etc/shells
```

* substring
