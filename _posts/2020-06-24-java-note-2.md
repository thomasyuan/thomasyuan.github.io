## Enum

```java
public enum SWITCH_STATE {
    OFF("The switch is off"),
    ON("The switch is on");

    private final String description;
    private SWITCH_STATE(String des) {
        description = des;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return description;
    }
}
```

## Assertion
Assertion by default is disabled, you can enable it at run time `java -ea YourClass`

## java.util.function package

I feel these interfaces are kind of useless because they are all FunctionInterface, 
which means when you use stream().filter or stream().forEach, you can just pass in a
lambda, you don't need those definiation at all.

### Predicate
An expression that returns a boolean
```java
public interface Predicate<T> {
    public boolean test(T t);
}
```

### Consumer
An expression that performs operations on a ojbect passed as argement and has
a void return type

```java
public interface Consume<T> {
    public void accept(T t);
}
```

### Function
Transforms a T to a U

```java
public interface Function<T, R> {
    public R apply(T t);
}
```

### Supplier
Provides an instance of a T (such as a factory)
```java
public interface Supplier<T> {
    public T get();
}
```

### example code

```java
    List<Student> students = new ArrayList<Student>();
    students.add(new Student("Austin"));
    students.add(new Student("Andrew"));

    Predicate<Student> bigBoy =
            t -> t.name().equals("Austin");

    Predicate<Student> littleBoy =
            t -> t.name().equals("Andrew");

    Consumer<Student> increaseToyBuget =
            t -> t.increaseToyBuget();

    students.stream()
        .filter(bigBoy)
        .forEach(increaseToyBuget);

    students.stream()
        .filter(littleBoy)
        .forEach(t -> System.out.println("Little boy is " + t.name()));


    students.stream().forEach(t -> System.out.println(t.name + " toy buget " + t.getToyBuget()));
```

## Lambda

Before Java SE 8, anonymous classes were typically used to pass functionality to 
a method. This practice obfuscated source code, making it harder to understand. 
Java 8 eliminated this problem by introducing lambdas.

Lambdas simplify the use of ***functional interfaces***, which are annotated 
interfaces that each declare exactly **one abstract method** (although they can 
also declare any combination of default, static, and private methods). One example
is `java.lang.Runnable` interface from the standard class library. It only has single
method which is `abstract void run()`.

Another good example of function interface

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface FucnctionalDemo {

  void letsDoSomething();
  //void letsGo();      //invalid because another abstract method does not allow
  public String toString();    // valid because toString from Object
  public boolean equals(Object o); //valid

  public static int sum(int a,int b)   // valid because method static
  {
    return a+b;
  }
  public default int sub(int a,int b)   //valid because method default
  {
    return a-b;
  }
}
```

### Lambda syntax
Every lambda conforms to the following syntax:

```java
( formal-parameter-list ) -> { expression-or-statements }
```
> ### Lambdas and var
> Starting with Java SE 11, you can replace a type name with var. For example, 
> you could specify (var a, var b).

### Lambdas and scopes
A lambda body doesn't introduce a new scope. Instead, its scope is the enclosing scope.

### Lambdas and local variables
A lambda body can define local variables. Because these variables are considered 
part of the enclosing scope, the compiler will report an error when it detects 
that the lambda body is redefining a local variable.

A local variable or parameter that's defined outside a lambda body and referenced 
from the body must be marked final or considered effectively final. 

### Lambdas and the 'this' and 'super' keywords
Any this or super reference that is used in a lambda body is regarded as being 
equivalent to its usage in the enclosing scope (because a lambda doesn't introduce
a new scope). However, **this isn't the case with anonymous classes**.

### Lambdas and exceptions
A lambda body is not allowed to throw ***more exceptions than are specified*** in 
the throws clause of the functional interface method. If a lambda body throws an 
exception, the functional interface method's throws clause must declare the same 
exception type or its supertype.
